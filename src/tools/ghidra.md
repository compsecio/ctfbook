# Ghidra

Ghidra is an open source tool from the National Security Agency (yes, that NSA!) that we use for reverse engineering.

Ghidra is a Java app, so you need a working JDK before you can run it. If you are on Kali Linux, you will need to run:
```sudo apt install jdk ```

You can download Ghidra [here](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

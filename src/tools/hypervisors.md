# Hypervisors

Hypervisors are the software piece that manage virtual machines and allow them access to your hardware. The three most common hypervisors for penetration testing or CTF competitions are:

* VMware
* VirtualBox
* Hyper-V
* KVM / QEMU

I find hypervisors to be a matter of personal preference -- each has a set of pros/cons. Some thoughts:

## VMware:
* The flagship VMware hypervisors are run on the largest servers in the world and are hugely expensive. The company provides some of this functionality in desktop versions, VMware Player (Intel/AMD) and VMware Fusion (Mac). While these cost money, they provide them free for non-commercial and academic use. These are my personal choice. Excellent networking, display tuning, snapshots, etc.

## VirtualBox
* Available [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/) Completely opposite of VMware... Open source and free. Very popular for hackers because of this. I wish it had better documentation, clipboard support, etc. But you can't beat the price.

## Hyper-V

## KVM/QEMU

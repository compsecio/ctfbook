# Base64 Encoding

Let's look at how we represent letters and numbers (characters) on a computer. Characters are mapped to numerical values, with that mapping being dependent on the language being used. For instance, computers in the United States often used a scheme known as [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (pronounced ask-ee), which contained 95 printable characters encoded into a 7 bit number. Over time, and due to the prevalence of 8-bit native computers, ASCII values were expanded to 8 bits.

It is therefore possible to a byte real quick... There are 256 possible values ranging from 0 to 255. If we wish to send those values over plaintext, however, we run
